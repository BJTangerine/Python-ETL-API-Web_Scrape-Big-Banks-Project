# Data Engineering ETL Project on Largest Banks by Market Capitalization
Extracts exchange rate data and list of largest banks by market capitalization using requests & BeautifulSoup libraries to perform API call and web scrape. Transforms data by applying an exchange rate from the extracted exchange rates data (in this case GBP) and applying that to the market capitalization column. "Loads" data into a CSV which can be easily loaded into an RDBMS. Also contains logging functions to log each step of the ETL process in a separate logs text file.
